            I INTRODUCTION
          </h2>
          <p className={styles.reader_p}>
            Over the course of the 20th century, global values, and motivations, pressured by nationalist
            movements, ushered in a period of decolonisation and independence which saw most colonies
            achieve self-government and nationhood. However, colonies like Australia and Canada
            possessed sizable quantities of colonial settlers compared to a subordinate indigenous
            population diminished by war, displacement, and western disease. These colonies gained
            independence with administrations which did not recognise pre-existing indigenous
            sovereignty and continued to be comprised of white leaders, governing for white settlers. The
            dismissal and discounting of indigenous sovereignty forms the basis for the diverse set of
            modern indigenous movements and voices which call for the recognition of early colonial indigenous
            history and some form of settlement to correct omissions in the legal and political
            narrative which has thus far persisted.
            <br /><br />
            Glen Coulthard is one of the diverse voices within the indigenous movement in Canada. Many
            indigenous experiences and views that apply in Canada are also relevant in the Australian
            context given the shared likeness of both countries’ colonial and indigenous experience. In his
            book <em>Red Skin, White Masks</em>, he discusses his views on the continually poor condition of
            indigenous state relations, drawing insights from Frantz Fanon’s work, especially with regards
            to indigenous mentalities<sup>1</sup>. This essay will explore the elements of Coulthard’s aversion to
            modern state-led recognition in II: parts A, B, C, D. I then discuss how those elements interact
            with modern settler state dynamics in II: parts E, F. Indeed, the title of this essay is inspired by
            the complex eventuality of needing to settle indigenous relations with a changed population
            and demographic to that which colonised Australia<sup>2</sup>. Part III will build off these discussions to
            specifically address the 2023 referendum on a Voice to Parliament and how views by both
            Coulthard and others inform the merits of a voice.

            A <em>Settler Colonialism</em>
          </h3>
          <p className={styles.reader_p}>
            The notion of settler colonisation describes the way western powers gained control and defacto
            sovereignty over previously occupied indigenous lands. It is based on the early legal myth
            that lands like Australia and Canada had no organised civilisation controlling the land prior to
            European arrival (terra nullius) and thus the establishment of a colony was by way of assertion
            and not conquest<sup>3</sup>. Whereas a conquest acknowledges the previous sovereignty of land acquired,
            assertion merely recognises ownership through possession, without regard for any pre-existing
            claims not recognised by European law. Hence, settlers were encouraged to encroach and
            displace indigenous people from their land, in a process which founded modern states including
            Australia and Canada.
            <br /><br />
            Coulthard notes that settler colonialism is not merely a spent occurrence from the past but
            rather a continued dispossession of indigenous lands and heritage through colonially
            established social structures and legal systems attempting to solidify the status-quo that they
            have created<sup>4</sup>. The state and its courts, supported by the settler majority has continued to
            manage previously indigenous land, and coerce indigenous subscription to settler institutions
            of education and economic productivity<sup>5</sup>. Participation in society must be on the settler’s terms
            using the settler’s law, the settler’s schools, and the settler’s capitalism<sup>6</sup>. Previous settler-state
            actions such as Canada’s 1969 <em>White Paper</em> and the Harper Apology have not delivered
            meaningful concessions to indigenous demands but rather set the goals of a settlement too
            closely to maintaining the status quo<sup>7</sup>. Coulthard argues that these are all examples of the
            coloniser’s previously overt, and now subtle desire to assimilate indigenous peoples to create
            a homogenous nation through the elimination of traditional indigenous practices and cultures<sup>8</sup>.
            Thus, this distrust of the system forms the basis for Coulthard’s argument to reject settler-state
            recognition initiatives, believing their end goals to be tokenistic and unchanging of the settler
            colonialist system at large.

            B <em>Reconciliation</em>
          </h3>
          <p className={styles.reader_p}>
            The aim of reconciliation has generally been to recognise past mistakes and attempt to find a
            consensus towards a better and stable future for indigenous-state relations. Numerous
            reconciliatory actions have been attempted across different settler states, called for by
            longstanding indigenous campaigning, but with terms and substance set by the government of
            the day<sup>9</sup>. Unsurprisingly, these governments, conservative and progressive, who were elected
            by and accountable to a majority non-indigenous electorate have frequently disappointed
            impassioned activists with the speed and size of progress. Progress, although minor, has been
            made. Royal Commissions have examined indigenous issues effectively including the Royal
            Commission into Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP) in Canada and the Royal Commission into
            Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in Australia<sup>10</sup>. This has led to the placement of indigenous
            outcomes on the government’s agenda including the Closing the Gap initiative in Australia<sup>11</sup>.
            Further, both Australian and Canadian parliaments have apologised for past perverse treatment
            of indigenous children<sup>12</sup>.
            <br /><br />
            There are two substantive issues Coulthard identifies as problematic with state-led
            reconciliation to date; the first is its grounding in a self-righteous belief that wrongdoing is
            confined to the past, failing to recognise the aforementioned continuing disruptions of settler
            colonialism<sup>13</sup>. Representations by government in <em>Gathering Strength</em>, the Canadian response
            to the RCAP, Coulthard argues, perpetuate the misleading impression that the Canada which
            dispossessed indigenous people is wholly different to that which exists today<sup>14</sup>. He believes
            that reconciliatory efforts are too focused on symptoms of settler colonialism such as the
            psychological injury or reputational damage to indigenous peoples rather than structural causes<sup>15</sup>. He
            believes that only through addressing the ongoing effect on indigenous people
            settler colonialism has had at the institutional and social levels can reconciliation be worthwhile.
            <br /><br />
            The second is the sentiment of finality or settlement arising from the reconciliation process.
            This concerns Coulthard because the reconciliation discussions governments are willing to
            have do not begin with all options on the table<sup>16</sup>. Thus, indigenous engagement or acceptance
            now of some state-led reconciliation act risks the inadvertent surrendering of the right to
            renegotiate for more ambitious concessions in the future including restitution, land transfers,
            political autonomy or even independence. Coulthard counsels indigenous people not to yield
            to the mirage of choice reconciliation presents. He believes feelings of resentment or anger are
            acceptable and preferrable to compromising one’s goals just to feel the goodness of
            forgiveness<sup>17</sup>. The utility of these feelings is discussed in the next section.

            C <em>Negritude</em>
          </h3>
          <p className={styles.reader_p}>
            Frantz Fanon in <em>Black Skin, White Masks</em> explores mentalities within indigenous minorities,
            which he points out can be both pacifying when exploited by a settler state or intensely
            empowering and aggravating when unlocked by a minority’s own consciousness<sup>18</sup>. Fanon
            observes that racist colonial biases, values, and economics have a devaluing effect on
            indigenous people, their traditions, and their way of life<sup>19</sup>. They innately or overtly come to
            internalise a lower self-worth and a need to change to improve. On the other hand,
            aforementioned emotions like anger or resentment with the colonial system and its values can
            cause indigenous people to “revalue and reaffirm” their “traditions and social practices”<sup>20</sup>. This
            generates a repudiation of common prejudices such as the supremacy of western systems and
            methodology amongst indigenous peoples, aiding in the assembly of a motivated coalition
            willing to act for their cause. Fanon describes this experience as “anti-racist racism” through
            which, he believes, revaluates minority culture and aids in a “broader struggle for freedom”<sup>21</sup>.
            <br /><br />
            Coulthard also uses Jean-Paul Sartre’s <em>Anti-Semite and Jew</em> to build on the destructive
            mentality colonial society can implant into indigenous people’s minds<sup>22</sup>. An inauthentic Jew,
            as Sartre describes, is one who assimilates; one who has fallen to the propaganda and given the
            “malevolent” system the power to endow them with their characteristics<sup>23</sup>. Unlike a Jew
            however, Sartre remarks that a person of colour cannot assimilate because they are visually
            identifiable<sup>24</sup>. So, if there is no recourse within the system, escape can only be through the
            abolition of racial differences beginning with the ending of self-imposed inferiority complexes
            and the rejection of existing relations of dominance<sup>25</sup>. Coulthard discusses Fanon and Sartre’s
            work with the conclusion being that a strengthened indigenous movement, with a national
            identity, “fighting culture” and a willingness to redefine social and economic norms is a good
            thing for indigenous people<sup>26</sup>. And this awakening can only come about through the emotions
            arising from a refusal to engage with a deemed unfair state-led recognition process.

            D <em>Resurgent Politics of Recognition</em>
          </h3>
          <p className={styles.reader_p}>
            For indigenous culture, traditions, and way of life to survive the settler state, Coulthard argues
            that indigenous peoples must practice a resurgent form of politics which consciously and
            confidently rejects the assimilative acts described in his discussions about both the settler state
            and its reconciliation attempts<sup>27</sup>. To do so, Coulthard relies on Fanon and Sartre’s work in
            building a mindset of pride, understanding and loyalty amongst modern indigenous people.
            Through this path and with this coalition, Coulthard believes the modern “politics of
            recognition” can be defeated. Survival relies on the failure of settler state negotiations and
            settlements which are still colonial as they at their core do not seek to reverse the effects of
            European settlement<sup>28</sup>. Modern politics of recognition keep the settler state in place, solidifying
            its unfair gains, and keeping indigenous peoples from true “inherent self-determination” or the
            possibility of true land control and self-determination<sup>29</sup>.
            <br /><br />
            Coulthard concludes his book with the realistic acknowledgement that “settler-colonialism has
            rendered [indigenous people] a radical minority in [their] own homelands” necessitating their continued
            engagement with the legal and political system<sup>30</sup>. I will discuss this actuality with
            reference to Coulthard’s arguments over parts E, F.

            E <em>Multiculturalism</em>
          </h3>
          <p className={styles.reader_p}>
            Over the past century, both Canada and Australia have accepted significant immigration, first
            from white European nations and then from diverse Asian, American, and African nations. As
            of 2021, 27% of the nation was not born in Australia, with non-white countries of India, China
            and the Philippines ranking in the top 5 countries of birth<sup>31</sup>. Like indigenous peoples, the
            multicultural community is diverse and non-homogenous. They likewise have faced their own
            challenges in balancing assimilation and coexistence. However, relations between migrants
            have progressed and stabilised much faster than with indigenous peoples. Unlike indigenous
            peoples, most migrants have consciously chosen to live in the “settler state” Australia, they are
            mostly concentrated in cities, and they can continue to look to their home country as a source
            of their cultural heritage. It would be a mistake then to presume the multicultural community’s
            goals and intentions align with that of the indigenous cause. Instead, Srikanth in
            <em>Multiculturalism and Aboriginal Peoples in Canada</em>, notes the opposite, that native activists
            view the politics of multiculturalism as a threat to the interests of indigenous people<sup>32</sup>. Povinelli
            in her article <em>Shame and Australian Multiculturalism</em> describes a similar behaviour trait of the
            settler state as Coulthard did<sup>33</sup>. She argues that multiculturalism in Australia has allowed the
            state to claim to recognise the value of cultural diversity, in contrast to its dark past
            characterised by racism and intolerance<sup>34</sup>. Multiculturalism acts as a testament to the settler
            state’s rehabilitated intentions, a view generally held by both migrant and non-migrant persons.
            Hence, the multicultural experiment is an example of how a liberal democracy comprised of
            apparatuses, laws, and principles, treating all equally and technocratically can provide prima
            facie successes of the multicultural experiment. This example, and the products of these
            examples (migrants) rebut the argument for the need for significant change and separation to
            settle race relations. These migrants, and the supporters of multiculturalism now hold significant political
            power through their population, and they are the group whose support of
            the indigenous cause will need to be attained to further its progression.

            F <em>Institutional Settlement</em>
          </h3>
          <p className={styles.reader_p}>
            The institutional settlement is a set of institutions, political systems and accepted norms
            between different classes and groups of people which provides a “minimum level of political
            stability and economic performance” for a society to operate<sup>35</sup>. It is the common acceptance
            for coexistence even if some decisions do not always align with one’s view. Settler nations
            such as Australia and Canada have long enjoyed such a settlement between first its European
            and then its multicultural citizens. Mushtaq Khan in <em>Political Settlements</em> concedes that the
            “minimum level” of operation creates benefits for groups based on their “relative power”,
            explaining the reason why indigenous communities do not currently have, as Coulthard sees it,
            acceptable rights, and privileges within society<sup>36</sup>. However, to maintain “social order” while
            retaining the support of relatively powerful groups within a society requires that benefits
            afforded by the social order are either relative to power, conceded voluntarily or enforced by
            existing institutions<sup>37</sup>.
            <br /><br />
            The reality of Coulthard’s vision for the future and role of indigenous communities within
            settler nations is that it will represent, and quite reasonably in my opinion, a significant shift in
            the distribution of rights and privileges within society. However, indigenous communities
            possess no majority or power base to make this change, nor, as Coulthard believes, should they
            expect existing institutions to significantly trade their own interests for indigenous ones<sup>38</sup>. This
            then only leaves having general society concede to indigenous demands voluntarily. Now
            Coulthard’s thesis on resurgent politics seeks to better the terms of any such concession through
            a less submissive ethos. But I hold significant concerns to the extent to which such a strategy
            will succeed. An all or nothing bluff is too risky as the internal consensus within modern
            Canada and Australia has become ever more fractured, with the rise of populists, nationalists
            and neoliberals being barely contained, if at all, by left of centre politics. The resurgence of
            One Nation, the rise of the right faction within the Liberal party and the trucking protests are among the
            examples<sup>39</sup>. The politicisation of indigenous activism risks losing moderate support
            and dooming past and medium-term future progress. I argue that irrespective of the merits of
            the end goal, if one is to seek recourse from within the system, and Coulthard has indicated
            that he does, consideration must be given to first maintaining the faith and support of a majority
            of the electorate which the indigenous minority now coexist with.

            III AN AUSTRALIAN VOICE TO PARLIAMENT
          </h2>
          <p className={styles.reader_p}>
            Australia has progressed in Aboriginal representation inside settler state institutions with the
            proportion of Indigenous parliamentarians currently higher than their proportion of the
            population. Additionally, Australians look likely to vote in a referendum to approve an
            Indigenous Voice to Parliament within the year. It will be an advisory body that delivers part
            of the three pillared “truth, treaty and voice” request delivered in 2017 by the <em>Uluru Statement
            from the Heart</em><sup>40</sup>. Passage will require greater than 50% of total electors and states to be in
            favour<sup>41</sup>. The referendum currently has the support of 1 major political party with regular
            polling indicating support around the mid to low fifties.

            The Voice fits within the type of modern recognition which Coulthard writes against. Despite
            it being the product of a large and legitimate congregation of Indigenous leaders, the Voice
            nonetheless is purely advisory and possesses no power to enforce change. It allows the status
            quo of the settler state to remain in place and without significant consequence. It will take
            Indigenous peoples down a miraged path of reconciliation and coexistence on the terms of the
            settler state without forcing a reawakening in Indigenous self-awareness and pride.

            B <em>Necessity</em>
          </h3>
          <p className={styles.reader_p}>
            The debate around the Voice has reaffirmed the fact that Indigenous peoples have diverse views
            and needs with people like Minister for Indigenous Affairs Linda Burney and Shadow Minister
            Jacinta Price, both claiming to represent some Indigenous view and speaking both in favour
            and against the Voice<sup>42</sup>. The Indigenous Australian community is not unanimous on the pathway set forth in
            the Uluru Statement, indeed some elders and community leaders may wish
            to seek true “inherent” self-government and sovereignty whilst others believe in coexistence
            and partial assimilation. Already a “radical minority”, large scale change has the best chance
            of success if different Indigenous peoples can unite under a similar and planned messaging.
            <br /><br />
            I do not believe Coulthard’s vision to pursue a resurgent politics is best suited to the current
            Australian environment, indeed his work predates much of the current developments in the
            Australian Indigenous movement (Uluru) as well as the political climate. Having Indigenous
            people withdraw, reflect, re-educate, and come back stronger is easier said than done to a large
            scale and diverse indigenous population. Framing peoples who have adopted some degree of
            assimilation as in-authentic or brainwashed denies them the agency to make choices for
            themselves and indeed risks regressing progress and support made towards Indigenous issues
            to date<sup>43</sup>.
            <br /><br />
            It is undeniable that the First Nations National Constitutional Convention, the Referendum
            Council and its 1200 submissions form the most comprehensive and legitimate survey of
            Indigenous people’s view as to the pathway to reconciliation<sup>44</sup>. For the first time,
            comprehensive enthusiasm towards state-led recognition has been expressed by Indigenous
            peoples on their terms. The Voice is a government response which implements one of its
            requests and it progresses Australia towards realistically repairing the disadvantage of
            Indigenous peoples caused by the settler state, past and present.

            IV CONCLUSION
          </h2>
          <p className={styles.reader_p}>
            The settler colonial Canada continues to disadvantage and dispossess indigenous peoples long
            after the end of its overtly racist policies. Coulthard first explained the Canadian experience
            with settler nation initiatives for reconciliation concluding that it cannot be trusted nor expected
            to expediently put on the agenda meaningful changes if it risks the settler nation’s existing
            powers or privileges. Instead, Coulthard has drawn form Fanon and Sartre’s perspectives that
            a rediscovery of indigenous pride, fuelled by the disillusionment and resentment at the settler
            state can create a new resurgent political attitude which will stand up for indigenous
            perspectives more effectively and forcefully.
            <br /><br />
            I have discussed practical limitations within Coulthard’s vision, namely the multicultural
            composition of modern settler states and the institutional settlement bounds we are all limited
            by. I have then looked at the feasibility of applying Coulthard’s vision to the Voice debate,
            ultimately concluding that whilst theoretically possible, it is not the ideal path forward. This
            conclusion is supported by the underlying differences between the Voice and past Canadian
            recognition attempts disparaged by Coulthard as well as a pragmatic foresight of the Australian
            political environment.
